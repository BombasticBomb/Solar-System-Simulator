# Solar-System-Simulator
A simple Solar System simulator made in python to get a tour of your planetary neighborhood.


To get started, execute the 'run.sh' file if you're in MacOS or Linux (MacOS users might have to make it executable first using sudo chmod +x run.sh). Windows users just need to run the solar_system.py file by left-clicking it.
The only dependencies required is Ursina and can be installed by running "pip install ursina".


Controls:
Use your mouse to look around.
Press Space to pause and unpause simulation.
Use arrow keys to increase and decrease speed of the simulation.
And use WASD while pressing Right-Click to move around.


Enjoy! And don't forget to email me code suggestions!
